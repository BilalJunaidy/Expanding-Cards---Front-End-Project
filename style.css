    /* By default in CSS, if you have an element that has a width and/or height css property set, 
    then this sets the height and width of the content box....However, if you were to add either 
    a value for border and/or padding for that element, then the total width and height of the 
    element in question will adjust using the following formulae
    width + padding + border = actual width of an element
    height + padding + border = actual height of an element

    Now, this (^) was the default CSS BX. However, what if we don't want the size of the element to 
    change were we do add height and width of the element but rather be contraints by it. 
    So for example if we use the box-sizing: border-box; property on an element, 
    then the impact of this would be that lets say you set the height and width of an element to be 100px, 
    then this 100px would include also the pixels alloted for the border and for the padding. 

    Just need to make sure that if I am using the following box-sizing property, then I am making sure not to 
    have a negative value for the height and the width of the content box. 

    Check out the illustration in the following link:
